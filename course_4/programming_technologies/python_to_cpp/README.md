## Introduction
<a name="introduction">

**libpypa** is a Python parser implemented in pure *C++*. It neither uses any
tools like [flex][1], [yacc][2], [bison][3] etc, nor is it using any parser
framework like [Boost.Spirit][4]. It's implementation is pure C++ code.


### Motivation
<a name="introduction-motivation">

I started getting involved into the [pyston project][5] where it had an entry
in their getting involved list for implementing a parser for Python. Never
having properly tackled the problem of creating a parser library for any
language, I decided it might be worth a try, since most of the libraries I
found, where basically just using the builtin Python parser or where
implemented in Python itself.

### Goal
<a name="introduction-goal">

The first goal of the library is to support python 2.7 syntax, later on 3.x
syntax might be added.


## Example
<a name="example">

An example file:

    $cat hello_world.py
    #! /usr/bin/env python
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    #

    """
        A "Hello World" example for the pypa parser
    """
    import sys

    print >> sys.stdout, "Hello", "World!"


And here the output of the test parser:

    $ ./parser-test hello_world.py
    Parsing successfull

    [Module]
      - body:
        [Suite]
          - items: [
                [DocString]
                  - doc:
        A "Hello World" example for the pypa parser


                [Import]
                  - names:
                    [Alias]
                      - as_name: <NULL>
                      - name:
                        [Name]
                          - context: Load
                          - dotted: False
                          - id: sys

                [Print]
                  - destination:
                    [Attribute]
                      - attribute:
                        [Name]
                          - context: Load
                          - dotted: False
                          - id: stdout
                      - context: Load
                      - value:
                        [Name]
                          - context: Load
                          - dotted: False
                          - id: sys
                  - newline: True
                  - values: [
                        [Str]
                          - value: Hello

                        [Str]
                          - value: World!
                        ]
                ]
      - kind: Module

And here the parse tree of python: (astdump.py can be found in tools)

    [Module]
        - body: [

            [Expr]
                - value:
                [Str]
                    - s:
        A "Hello World" example for the pypa parser


            [Import]
                - names: [

                    [alias]
                        - asname: None
                        - name: sys
                ]

            [Print]
                - dest:
                [Attribute]
                    - attr: stdout
                    - ctx: Load
                    - value:
                    [Name]
                        - ctx: Load
                        - id: sys
                - nl: True
                - values: [

                    [Str]
                        - s: Hello

                    [Str]
                        - s: World!
                ]
        ]


## Error Reporting
<a name="error-reporting">

The parser supports also SyntaxError and IndentionError reporting:

Let's take a look at this file `syntax_error.py` which clearly has a
syntax error:

    #! /usr/bin/env python
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    """
        Syntax error example
    """

    print x y z

This is the output of the test parser:

    $./parser-test syntax_error.py
      File "syntax_error.py", line 7
        print x y z
                ^
    SyntaxError: Expected new line after statement
    -> Reported @pypa/parser/parser.cc:944 in bool pypa::simple_stmt(pypa::{anonymous}::State&, pypa::AstStmt&)

    Parsing failed

And this of cpython 2.7:

    $ python syntax_error.py
      File "syntax_error.py", line 7
        print x y z
                ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax

**libpypa** uses different error messages than python, however in the hopes that
that would increase the clarity.

## Requirements
<a name="requirements">

To be able using **libpypa**, you have to have a *C++11* compiler available.
**libpypa** was developed on top of *g++ 4.8.2* and it heavily uses *C++11*
features where seen fit.

**libpypa** currently does not depend on any other libraries than the *C++11*
standard library with the exception of the `class FileBuf` which currently
uses system libraries, but might be changed to just use `fopen`/`fread`/
`fclose`.

## Structure
<a name="structure">

**libpypa** currently consists of 3 major parts:

 1. `Lexer`
 2. `Parser`
 3. `AST`

### Lexer
<a name="structure-lexer">

The `Lexer` portion of the library tokenizes the input for the `Parser` and
distinguishes the different types of tokens for the `Parser`.

### Parser
<a name="structure-parser">

The `Parser` utilizes the `Lexer` to parse the input and generates a
preliminary `AST` from the input.

### AST
<a name="structure-ast">

The AST contains the definition of all syntax elements in the code. The main
parts of the definition are in `pypa/ast/ast.hh` which makes heavily use of
preprocessor macros to define typedefs, mappings for compile time type lookups
by AstType (enum class), and an implementation for a switch based visitor.

The AST types do not implement any methods, they are just structures with data.
The only thing which is in there for some of the bases is the constructor, to
set the type id value and initialize the line and column values.
