### Pacman in Python with PyGame

This is a very minimal implementation of the Pacman game, having only one level and without ghosts strategy, not even with random movements (yes, the routes are programmed). However, we may improve this game in the future and everyone else interested can feel free to fork and contribute to this project.

# Future development

* Fix Pacman's movement
* Ghosts moving algorithm and artificial intelligence
* Better design
* Better algorithm for the walls
* Additional levels?


Tested with [PyGame 1.9](http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.2a0.win32-py3.2.msi ) and [Python 3.2 32bit](http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.2.3/python-3.2.3.msi)
