README for TLM-2.0 (part of SystemC 2.3.1)
==========================================

This is the proof of concept implementation for the OSCI TLM-2.0 standard,
as defined by the IEEE 1666-2011 SystemC Language Reference Manual.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                IMPORTANT

1. This version of the TLM-2.0 code is version 2.0.3. It has some minor changes
   compared to the previous version. For details of changes, please refer to the
   SystemC RELEASENOTES file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Licensing and Copyright

   See the LICENSE file for SystemC.

Installation

   Please follow the INSTALL instructions for SystemC.

Release Notes

   See the separate SystemC RELEASENOTES file.

User Documentation

   You can find documentation for this release in the docs directory.
   A doxygen.in configuration file is available which may be used to build
   documentation using Doxygen (www.doxygen.org).

   The TLM library is documented in the IEEE 1666-2011 SystemC Language
   Reference Manual.  This may be obtained by visiting the Accellera Systems
   Initiative at www.accellera.org.

   Some older documentation has been retained in the docs/release directory.
   It is    recommended that you start with the training presentation
   (TLM_2_0_presentation.ppt) and then obtain and read the
   SystemC Language Reference Manual.

   See docs/release/README.txt for a description and status of the other
   documentation.

Directory Structure

   SystemC and TLM code now have a common directory structure. The TLM header
   files are in the same include directory as the SystemC header files.

   The previous unit_test directory has been merged into the separate
   systemc-regressions download, available from www.accellera.org.

   There are some examples in the folder examples/tlm, and documentation in 
   docs/tlm.

Build Support

   Support for building the examples  is provided for 'unix', and
   'msvc' (project and make files).

   Makefiles work hierarchically.  'build' is the default target; 'clean',
   'run' (executes built tests/examples) and 'check' (against expected 
   results) targets are also provided.

   On Unix/Linux/MacOS, the $SYSTEMC_HOME environment variable should be set to
   point to the SystemC root location; $TARGET_ARCH (or $ARCH_SUFFIX) should be
   defined such that $SYSTEMC_HOME/lib-$TARGET_ARCH (or lib$ARCH_SUFFIX) is a
   directory containing the SystemC library.
   On Windows, the SYSTEMC environment variable should be used.

Examples

   There is a set of examples available under the examples/tlm directory, they
   illustrate the key features of the TLM-2.0 standard. For more information see
   the README.txt.
