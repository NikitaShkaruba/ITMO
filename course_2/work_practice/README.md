# Practice enterance project
Sample enterance project, some kind of enterance to JavaEE :)

## Running portlet
There are some hardcoded datavase access strings in Persistence.XML.
So you can't just compile source and then add working portlet, because my database was hosted on www.freemysqlhosting.net, and this site gives free access db in a week.
